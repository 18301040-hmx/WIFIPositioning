## Background and requirements analysis
随着移动互联网时代的到来，定位服务需求量迅速增长，例如大型商场或候机厅快速找到出口、家长跟踪小孩的位置、房屋根据人员位置控制电灯开关、商店根据用户位置向用户推送关于商品的介绍等。如今室外定位技术已经发展十分成熟，然而在室内环境中，经常会出现“都市峡谷”效应，GPS系统无法精确定位。随着无线网络的覆盖范围越来越广，基于WiFi的无线定位技术可以弥补卫星定位在建筑密集区和室内应用的限制，扩大定位服务的应用行业和范围。高校的教学楼楼层多，教室多，各种功能区域分布不够清晰，因此对于师生以及校外人员寻找相应的教室、会场或办公室存在一定的困扰。
　　本项目针对以上需求，设计了一款基于WIFI的室内定位系统。该系统由客户端应用和后台定位服务构成，用户可以通过智能终端进行定位，并在终端的地图上显示定位位置，同时服务器端记录用户定位时间、AP名称及接收的信号强度指示等定位信息。用户可以在北交大校园内的教学楼办公楼中使用该APP，可以实时定位用户的所在位置和楼层，并显示周围教室办公室等场所的功用和使用反馈。例如，在109教室自习过的同学，可以在APP上点击109教室并写下该教室的设备故障情况，环境情况，自习同学的多少等反馈，为其他同学选择自习室提供参考。该APP还可以为老师提供便捷的课堂签到功能，通过查看学生的实时定位，来确认学生是否在教室和迟到早退。当用户经过一些特定的房间时，可以通过提示来向用户推送“广告”，比如周边最多人去的自习室，空调故障无法使用的教室等等。
  
With the advent of the mobile Internet era, the demand for location services has grown rapidly. For example, large shopping malls or waiting halls quickly find exits, parents track the location of children, houses control light switches based on personnel positions, and stores push users about products based on user locations. Introduction etc. Nowadays outdoor positioning technology has developed very mature, but in the indoor environment, the "urban canyon" effect often occurs, and the GPS system cannot accurately locate. With the increasing coverage of wireless networks, WiFi-based wireless positioning technology can make up for the limitations of satellite positioning in densely built areas and indoor applications, and expand the application industry and scope of positioning services. There are many teaching buildings and classrooms in colleges and universities, and the distribution of various functional areas is not clear enough. Therefore, there is a certain amount of trouble for teachers and students and outside school staff to find corresponding classrooms, venues or offices.
　　 This project has designed an indoor positioning system based on WIFI to meet the above requirements. The system consists of a client application and a background positioning service. The user can perform positioning through an intelligent terminal and display the positioning location on the terminal's map. At the same time, the server records location information such as the user's positioning time, AP name, and received signal strength indication. Users can use the APP in the office building of the teaching building on the campus of Beijing Jiaotong University, which can locate the user's location and floor in real time, and display the function and use feedback of the surrounding classrooms and offices. For example, students who have studied in Class 109 can click on Class 109 on the APP and write down the equipment failure, environmental conditions, and the number of students who have studied in the classroom to provide reference for other students to choose the study room. The APP can also provide teachers with a convenient classroom sign-in function, by checking the student's real-time location to confirm whether the student is in the classroom and is late and early leaving. When users pass some specific rooms, they can use prompts to push "ads" to users, such as self-study rooms with the most people around, classrooms where air-conditioning failures cannot be used, and so on.
